Review the claude.md against current best practices and update as needed

## Prompt

please havea  read of the latest claude code docs here:
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/

if possible read up on all the docs and subpages as well.

consider going a search for the most up-to-date best practices on using claude code and the claude.md
file.

with all this new knowledge please review our own claude.md file.

lets analyze and evaluate what is good, what is bad, what is missing, and really focus on removing
cruft.

my gut says there is some repetition and redundancy here. and other parts of this file should actually
 be moved to documentation.

have a read, think through it, and ping back
